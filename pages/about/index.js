          Ahoy, Itâ€™s Tom or Tomek, as everyone calls me back in Poland where I grew up. I am a
          London based software developer specializing in frontend, particularly JavaScript, React
          and React Native. The UK has been home my whole adult life, but a lot of time is spent
          travelling between the US, Mexico and Poland.

          I started building websites in secondary school but havenâ€™t pursued it as a career until
          2019. In between I got myself a business degree, a fruitful career in sales and
          recruitment, which I then switched for a dream of owning a restaurant. Hereâ€™s where
          taco-tomek comes from. Iâ€™ve also done a fair share of travelling and backpacking which
          really helped shaping who I am now.

          Hard work is really in my core. When I decided to make a switch to a full time career as a
          developer, I had quite a bit of catching up to do. I have been dedicating my whole spare
          time on getting better at what I do. 2 years on and I still canâ€™t see the light at the end
          of the tunnel. Thereâ€™s just so much to learn and I love it! If you want to learn more
          about my journey into tech, check the article I wrote here: LINK .
